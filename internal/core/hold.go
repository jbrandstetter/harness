// Hold Reasons
//
// A harness the daemon keeps down on purpose (not a crash, not an operator
// stop) is held, and it is held for one or more reasons: its operating hours
// are closed, its provider's quota is exhausted (a park), or a budget is
// spent. A hold is a set of those reasons, not a flag, so a park that expires
// out of hours leaves the harness held for hours, and the harness starts again
// only when its last reason clears. The supervisor keeps the set; the harness
// projection carries it as hold_reasons, in canonical order.
//
// Governing: ADR-0027, SPEC-0021 REQ-14 "Release and hold reasons", REQ-16
// "Listing surfaces"; design.md § "Holds become a reason set". It amends
// ADR-0019 / SPEC-0012 REQ "Gate Enforcement", whose `held` is now "held for
// at least one reason".
//
