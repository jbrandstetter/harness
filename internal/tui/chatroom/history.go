package chatroom

// Chatroom History
//
// The watcher that feeds the chatroom only shows what happened in the last
// fifteen minutes (internal/tui/watcher.go, historyWindow), and it can only see
// the session stores of the machine the TUI runs on, in their default places.
// A sweep that finished an hour ago, a crush harness keeping its sessions under
// its own data directory, and every harness on a remote daemon were all
// invisible — the chatroom opened empty on a fleet that had done a day's work.
//
// So on open the chatroom also asks the daemon for each harness's latest run,
// the same structured `logs` reply `harness logs` prints, and merges it into
// the stream by time. The daemon attributes those sessions itself, with each
// harness's real store and environment, so they arrive already knowing whose
// they are: a session named by history keeps that harness as its speaker, even
// for the live events that follow it.
//
// History and the watcher overlap for anything recent, so every row carries a
// key built the way runtrace builds an entry's ID — session, then seq for a
// tool call — and a row whose key is already buffered is dropped.
//
// Governing: ADR-0015 (chatroom TUI), SPEC-0009 REQ "Multi-Harness Event
// Aggregation", SPEC-0006 REQ "Run Correlation".
//
// @joestump-agent 09/27/2026 - Added: the chatroom opened empty unless an
// agent had acted in the last fifteen minutes.
