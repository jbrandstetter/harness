# Run the merge train

The merge train lands approved pull requests one at a time. For each one it
builds a `train/<pr>` branch (`main` plus a squash of the PR), waits for CI on
that exact commit, squash-merges the PR, and then checks that the tree that
landed is the tree that was tested. Reviewers approve and stop there. The
train does the merging, and no LLM session merges anything. The design is
ADR-0032 and the behaviour is SPEC-0025.

This guide covers turning it on for one repository, the pilot that comes
first, the cutover, and how to back out.

## Before you enable it

1. **CI runs on train branches.** The repository's pipeline must run on a
   `push` to `train/**` as well as `main`. For this repo that is the
   `branches: [main, 'train/**']` line in `.gitea/workflows/pipeline.yaml`.
   Nothing else in the pipeline changes. The image push and the docs deploy
   are already limited to `main`.
2. **Do not add a branch-protection rule for `train/*`.** A rule whose push
   allowlist contains only the train's identity looks right, but on Gitea
   1.27.0 the forge refuses deletion of a protected branch both through the
   REST `branches` endpoint and through push-delete (glob rules count), and
   the train deletes `train/<pr>` after every attempt and again before
   rebuilding. With the rule in place, every attempt leaves its branch
   behind, the next push for that PR is non-fast-forward, and every later
   tick for that PR fails (stump.wtf/harness#821). The rule also protects
   nothing the train relies on: the train never trusts a branch tip. It
   tests the combined status of the exact commit it built and, after the
   merge, verifies the landed tree is the tested tree. Anyone with write
   access can still create a `train/<pr>` branch; that only misleads humans
   reading branch names, and review covers the tree that lands.
3. **A token for the train's identity**, with write access to the repo, in
   the daemon's environment. It never goes in `harness.toml`.

## Pilot: report mode

Enable the train in `report` mode alongside the existing process, with
`block_on_outdated_branch` still on:

```toml
[mergetrain]
enabled = true
mode = "report"
repos = ["stump.wtf/harness"]
forge_base_url = "https://gitea.stump.rocks"
forge_token_env = "HARNESS_MERGETRAIN_TOKEN"
```

In `report` mode the train builds and tests trains exactly as it would for
real, but it writes nothing to any pull request: no merge and no comment.
Watch the daemon log for these lines:

| Line | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `merge train enabled` | the start, naming the mode, repos and forge identity |
| `mergetrain queue` | the eligible PRs, in merge order, whenever the queue changes |
| `mergetrain would merge` | a train went green, and in `merge` mode this PR would have landed |
| `mergetrain would comment` | a conflict, red CI or timeout the author would have been told about |
| `mergetrain bypass detected` | `main` moved without the train |

Run it for a week and count trains built, green versus red, and the causes of
failures. The bar for going further is set by the agent-contention epic that
proposed the train, and by stump.wtf/harness#540:

- replays under 3% of PRs;
- no untested tree merged;
- no merge made by an LLM session;
- `main` red only from flakes.

## Cutover

In one change, and for one repository only:

1. Set `mode = "merge"` and restart the daemon.
2. Turn off `block_on_outdated_branch` for that repo's `main` rule:

   ```sh
   tea api --login gitea.stump.rocks -X PATCH \
     repos/stump.wtf/harness/branch_protections/main \
     -F block_on_outdated_branch=false
   ```

While the block is still on, the forge refuses to merge any PR that is behind
`main`, so a train in `merge` mode would get `merge-refused` for nearly every
PR. That is why the two changes go together. The train deliberately does not
work around the block by running the forge's "update branch" on refused PRs:
an update creates a new head SHA, which orphans every existing approval (the
PR becomes `no approval on current head` and stale approvals are dismissed),
so the PR would loop out of the queue until a reviewer re-approved it — while
rewriting the author's branch as a side effect. The stuck-PR path is instead
the one-comment author todo, and the block comes off at cutover because the
train's tested-tree guarantee is exactly the guarantee the block was
providing. The reasoning is written up in ADR-0032, *Relationship to the
rebase update*.

### Lesson (b): reviewer must not rebase a merely-behind branch with the block off

With `block_on_outdated_branch=false`, a reviewer who force-rebases a PR that
is merely behind `main` causes the approval to be dismissed — the PR becomes
unstale, but the approval is no longer attached to its new head. Rebase only
to resolve conflicts; after conflicts are resolved, the PR should be left as
is. The train's own `update branch` style merges the base into the PR (not a
rebase) to keep approvals attached.

### Lesson (c): a harness redeploy kills scratchpads and cancels a train in flight

When the train is merging and a harness redeploy starts, scratchpad workers
are killed and in-flight train runs are cancelled by context. The daemon starts
an empty queue on restart; does not resume where it left off. A halted queue is
not a resumed run — the only recovery to a red CI after a cut-over is a fresh
deploy and redeploy.

## Rollback

Put the block back:

```sh
tea api --login gitea.stump.rocks -X PATCH \
  repos/stump.wtf/harness/branch_protections/main \
  -F block_on_outdated_branch=true
```

Then set `mode = "report"` (or `enabled = false`) and restart the daemon.
Check that the block really is on again by reading the rule back rather than
trusting the PATCH's exit code (`tea api` exits 0 even on an error):

```sh
tea api --login gitea.stump.rocks \
  repos/stump.wtf/harness/branch_protections/main \
  | jq .block_on_outdated_branch
```

Roll back if any of these happen:

- the daemon log shows `mergetrain halted`. That means a merge landed a tree
  other than the one CI tested. Revert that merge too.
- `main` goes red on a commit the train merged and a rerun of the same SHA is
  still red. That is a real integration failure the train should have caught.
- a merge on `main` has no `Merge-Train: tested as …` line and no
  `mergetrain-bypass:` comment on its PR.

## When the train halts

A halt means verification failed after a merge. Either `main` was not at the
merge commit, the merge commit's tree was not the tested tree, or a changed
file's bytes did not land. The PR gets a `verify-failed` comment and the
driver attempts nothing more until the daemon restarts. Find out why before
restarting. The daemon log's `mergetrain halted` line names the PR and both
trees.

## Landing something with the train down

1. Run the forge's rebase update on the PR, so CI tests the tree that will
   land.
2. Merge it by hand once CI is green.
3. Comment `mergetrain-bypass: <reason>` on the PR.

The train logs `bypass detected` for any `main` head it did not produce, so a
bypass that skipped step 3 still shows up in the daemon log.

## Known limits

- **One PR per train (today).** The current binary spends one CI run per PR:
  a 10-minute pipeline lands at most about six PRs an hour. Batching — up to
  `batch` PRs sharing one train commit, bisecting by halves on red — is
  specified as SPEC-0025 REQ-17 and is not yet in the binary. The daemon
  accepts `batch` (at least 1) so the config loads, but still builds one PR
  per train and logs `merge train: batch is not implemented yet` at start
  when it is above 1.
- **One attempt per (head, base).** The driver merges each PR once per (head,
  base) pair and records the result (success, would merge, merge refused,
  verified, etc.). A red attempt is retried only after the head or base
  moves (a new merge attempt is initiated, or the PR needs reapproval on a
  new head). Each head that reaches verification generates one author-todo
  comment on the PR (even after merge).
- **Singleton per host.** Enable the train in exactly one daemon's config.
  Two daemons on different hosts would race. The re-check before each merge
  and the tree verification after it limit the damage to one merge and a
  halt, but they don't prevent the race.
- **The train runs the PR's own pipeline.** The train commit contains the
  PR's changes, including any change to `.gitea/workflows/`. That is the
  same trust PR CI already extends to a same-repo branch, and review is what
  covers it.
